A PowerShell script that generates a random ASCII cat. 

![asciicat on PowerShell](/projects/img/asciicat.png)

This program reads a list of ASCII cats and prints one chosen randomly. My personal use case for this script is in my PowerShell profile - on shell launch (unless a `-NoProfile` flag is passed), I will be greeted by an ASCII cat. 

```
  ^--^ ____
 ( 0w0/    J      
\(  >/<  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  <*))><  ~ ~ ~
```
